# d3 Notebook Visualization Website

## Link
Website completely developed by me:

## Goal
This website was developed during a Research Assistant position at UIUC. The goal of the project was to provide a way for the Professor I was working under to visualize her research data in a clean and appealing format. She was using Observable Notebook, a website which allows users to create data notebooks without having to worry about dependencies and multiple libraries. Everything needed to develop a d3 notebook is provided simply by the website. However, it would not be appealing for the Professor to only display her research in that website. For that reason, we decided that it would be better to create an external website which could host those notebooks independently. To achieve this, I decided to create a website using, HTML, CSS, and JS, that could host these d3 notebooks all in one place and completely independently. This was achieved by downloading the raw code from Observable Notebook. With some tweaking, I was able to completely integrate these notebooks into the website I had designed.

## Features
This website makes it easy for someone to transport a d3 notebook from Observable Notebook into an externally and independently hosted site. No complicated dependencies, packages or imports. As long as you can download code from Observable, or a similar application, the rest is simple. I also created a Projects and Gallery page which would showcase cool-looking visualizations. It's kind of like Medium.com but for data visualizations. 

## Technology Used
I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS for this project. All animations were done with CSS or JS. Front-end was done with HTML and CSS. In order to integrate the d3 notebooks, runtime JS scripts were used. 

## Plans for the Future
This is version 1 of the website. I will continue to update it as needed or if there are any simple improvements I can think of. For the future, it would be cool to use ReactJS instead, this would simplify some of the processes of the website and would better suit the use case. I also could've been more creative with animations.
